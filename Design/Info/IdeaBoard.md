# Brainstorming

Language(s): Python, React, MySQL

## Types of Solutions

- web application
- mobile app
- website

## Do we want to create something for one-time use or continuous use?
    - continous use longevity in app usage makes for a dynamic and useful solution that does not use resources needlessly

## [user group] needs [solution] to [problem/why is it important?] Done for the main idea for now

# user groups
    - public transit users:
        - students, senior citizens, physically disabled people, youth, non-drivers

# problem / why is it important 
    - current apps do not provide specific information on the routes predicted for users and not allow for specific parameters for each route. For example only a select few of subway stations are accessible and some apps do not account for that in the routes generated for users. Additionally, some routes include out of station transfers resulting in long walks and additional payment.

    - public transit users should have an app that allows them to choose their own route at based on what they prefer to do as no route has to be the same in order to be "optimized"

# Solutions/ Ideas

## Smart Transit app (Main Idea for now)

Mobile / web application that combines the features of citymapper, google maps and chat gbt to allows users to be able to input specific indiviualized parameters for their public transit commute. Utilizing publicly accessible apis on the MTA's public transit, as well as information station accessibility, and chat gbt like generative artifical intelligence, users will be able to input their destination and specify how they want to travel and the app generates differen paths specifically designed.

## CitySafeguard / StormSafe

Web Application implementing weather-based APIS to predict flooding or vulnerabilites in New York CIty
Aims to prevent new york residents from suffering from natural disasters.

- By utilizing this app, residents can avoid repeated dangerous red zones or flee to shelter before the storm strikes.

## InfraRat / Ratscape

Web Application implementing trash dataframe to visualize problem areas in New York City's trash management.
Aims to spread awareness to lack of government actions to reduce rat and pest populations within residential areas.

- By displaying data, residents along with those in the New York state will notice the detrimental effects of trash that have taken over the city.

## AI Shopping System

Web Application that will users to search for a specific product. The AI will be trained on shopping data and provide results that are related to the search. Users may find items that they didn't realize they wanted or needed, and the AI will be further trained based on their searches.

## Women Safety App

Mobile App that will allow users to report safety issues in the local area so that others are aware of areas to stay away from. It will also allow users to input emergency contacts so they can contact help quickly and safely. It can also have recording and location sharing features that are easy to toggle on and off, but easily camoflauges with other apps.

## Subway Route Planner

Mobile App that will use up to date subway data to provide the user with the best route to their destination. It will take into account delays, weekend and night-time schedules, and subway schedules when producing a route. May even provide a few different routes based on preferences such as "no busses." Allows users to navigate the MTA more efficiently.

MTAPI is a small HTTP server that converts the MTA's realtime subway feed from Protocol Buffers/GTFS to JSON. The app also adds caching and makes it possible to retrieve information by location and train line.
