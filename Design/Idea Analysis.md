## Criteria to judge each of our ideas / solutions by:

| Prompt             | Idea/ Solution             |
| :---               |     :---:                  |  
| For                | /* Target Customer */      |
| Who                | /* need or pain point */   | 
| Our solution is a  | /* category of product */  | 
| That               | /*   key benefit  */       | 
| Unlike             | /* competitors */          | 
| Our solution       | /* key differentiator  */  | 
| Because            | /* proof point */          | 


# Smart Transit app

| Prompt             | Idea/ Solution                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---               |     :---:                                                                                                                                                         |  
| For                | public transit users, students, youth, physically disabled, senior citizens                                                                                       |
| Who                | current transit apps dont allow for individualization in routes outputted for destinations                                                                        | 
| Our solution is a  | mobile or ios/ web-app app                                                                                                                                                 | 
| That               | gives users more range to plot their public transit commute based on their preferences                                                                            | 
| Unlike             | CityMapper, Google Maps, Apple Maps, Transit, Chat GBT, My MTA                                                                                                    | 
| Our solution       | using generative ai we can plot of various routes for users to use that incorporates their parameters such an transfer locations, walkability, and accessibility  | 
| Because            | users have limited preference range in currently available apps so combining the good in those apps to make one better solution would optimize everyones commute  |
